# QtMinesweeper

#### QtMinesweeper is my version of classic minesweeper game written in Qt C++ framework.  
If you want just run the application, simply download latest version from  "releases" tab.  
To compile code by yourself, open QtMinesweper.pro file in QtCreator IDE or qmake.

### Hints
* You must uncover all the fields without mines to win. Just marking them isn't enough. Bombs counter and marks are only there to help you, but progress label shows real percentage of properly clicked fields.  
* Middle (or simultaneous left and right) click uncovers all neighbouring fields, excluding those marked as mines.
* Arrow button in the middle of the upper bar is always active, even though it's dimmed for the most of the time.

### Have fun!
